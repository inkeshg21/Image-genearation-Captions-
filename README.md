## Introduction
This assignment aims to describe the content of an image by using CNNs and RNNs to build an Image Caption Generator. The model would be based on using Tensorflow and Keras. The dataset used is [Flickr 8K](https://www.kaggle.com/adityajn105/flickr8k), consisting of 8,000 images each one paired with five different captions to provide clear descriptions. 
The implementation has been done using Python in a Jupyter notebook, where every step is carefully documented.
